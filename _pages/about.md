I am a first-year undergraduate student in the **[Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/)** at **[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)**.

Currently, I am a research intern at the **[MARS Lab](https://group.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~marslab/#/)** at the [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS)](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by Prof. **[Hang Zhao](https://hangzhaomit.github.io)**. My research interests lie broadly in **Robotics** and **Embodied AI**.

Additionally, I am a member of the **TH-MOS** (Tsinghua Master of Soccer) robot soccer team, working on Gait Control algorithms for competitive robots.

Outside of research, I am a passionate pianist and a member of the **Tsinghua University Clavier Team**. I also enjoy playing frisbee with the CS department team.
